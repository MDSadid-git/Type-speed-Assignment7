      <h2>
        (1) what is the difference between localstorage and sessionstorage?
      </h2>
      <p>
        sessionStorage is similar to localStorage ; the difference is that while
        data in localStorage doesn't expire, data in sessionStorage is cleared
        when the page session ends. Whenever a document is loaded in a
        particular tab in the browser, a unique page session gets created and
        assigned to that particular tab.
      </p>
      <h2>(2) what is the difference between global scope and block scope?</h2>
      <p>
        In a browser environment, the global scope is controlled by the window
        object while in Node. js, it's controlled by the global object. Block
        scopes are what you get when you use if statements, for statements, and
        the like.
      </p>
      <h2>(3) The event loop.</h2>
      <p>
        JavaScript has a runtime model based on an event loop, which is
        responsible for executing the code, collecting and processing events,
        and executing queued sub-tasks. This model is quite different from
        models in other languages like C and Java.
      </p>
      <h2>(4) How do I get undefined in JavaScript?</h2>
      <p>
        You will get undefined value when you call a non-existent property or
        method of an object. In the above example, a function Sum does not
        return any result but still we try to assign its resulted value to a
        variable. So in this case, result will be undefined.
